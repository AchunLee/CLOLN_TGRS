# IEEE_TGRS_CLOLN
[TGRS 2024]The code in this toolbox implements the proposed network CLOLN in "Channel-Layer-Oriented Lightweight Spectral-Spatial Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification". <br />
and the other two compared methods called Res-LS2CM and Ghostnet in "A lightweight spectral-spatial convolution module for hyperspectral image classification" and "Ghostnet for hyperspectral image classification", respectively.
